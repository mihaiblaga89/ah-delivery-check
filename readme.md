Checks AH delivery slots by postcode.

`npm install -g @mihaiblaga89/ah-delivery`

`ahdl check <postcode>`

Disclaimer: I have hunch that AH might thake other things into consideration like your cookie and the logged in user (if you are logged in) so you _might_ not see the available slots presented by `ahdl` when you open the website. But I'm still investigating this and if that's the case, I'll add support for it in a later version. For now the website shows the same data as this script, in my case.
